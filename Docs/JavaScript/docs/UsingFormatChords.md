## FormatChords.js

### Using Google Docs AppScript, format chords which follow a specific notation convention

This example of a traditional song represents the reuqirement nicely:

``` 
As [C]I was going over the [Am]far famed Kerry Mountains
I [F]met with Captain Farrell and his [C]money he was counting
I [C]first produced my pistol and I [Am]then produced my rapier
Saying, [F]"Stand and deliver for you [C]are a bold deceiver"

I [C]counted out his money and it [Am]made a pretty penny
I [F]put it in me pocket and I [C]took it home to Jenny
She [C]sighed and she swore that she [Am]never would deceive me
But the [F]devil take the woman for they [C]never can be easy
```

The square brackets are used to denote the chords that are played at that point in the song. The goal is to write a function that will format the chords in the song to have some emphasis, such as bold and blue.  
See FormatChords.js for a solution that makes those chord symbols bold and blue. The solution is specific to Google Docs, but can be adapted to other environments.
